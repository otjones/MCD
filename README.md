Multi-Channel Deconvolution V1.0

*Currently only compiled for macOS

This tool searches through a specified folder for all .wav files and performs the deconvolution on each channel of each recording with the “inv.wav” file which must be in the specified folder.

The tool creates an output folder in the specified folder, and creates a folder for each .wav file, copying its name, where each impulse response is saved for each channel of that .wav file
